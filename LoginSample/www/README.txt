This is a simple login screen made using
PhoneGap, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

The current version allows registration of multiple users
and saves their logins and passwords using local storage.

TODO:
-----

-Prevent more than one user from registering under the same username.
-find a way to save data to a database rather than using local storage for security reasons.
